AngularJS is a great JavaScript Framework. After 1 month learning, now I'm trying to construct an application by using AngularJS. It's a difficult process. But more practising could be a good starting. Nonsense no say, Now what i'm facing is how Angular could be used to building an application, what project need to be structure, and which pattern should be choice. Following this "H2W", maybe furher "H3W" - consider "who would intrerest in this App".
